## Asynchronous networking library for C3

### General goals

- Build on top of polling events, tasks are async.
- Provide implementations of server and client.
- Improve correctness and security.
- Improve usability, keep things simple where possible.
- This should not be a full comprehensive "framework".

This is very experimental, i would not recommend to use in production in any way. The internals __will__ change and C3 is also changing rapidly at the moment.

Discussions and PRs are welcome :D.
